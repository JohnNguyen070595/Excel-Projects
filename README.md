# Hotel-Dashboard
Hi everyone,
I'm excited to introduce my Excel dashboard! While Excel may have some limitations compared to Power BI, what I appreciate most is its ease of use and the convenience of features like pivot tables, as well as its flexibility in shaping and organizing data for reports.
For this project, I focused on the following key points, which I'll walk you through:
Understanding business context and stakeholders
Defining business questions
Identifying potential insights for the report
Performing data transformations
Highlighting specific insights
Providing actionable recommendations
Leveraging useful resources
