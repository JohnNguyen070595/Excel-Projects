Hi everyone,

I'm excited to introduce my Excel dashboard! While Excel may have some limitations compared to Power BI, what I appreciate most is its ease of use and the convenience of features like pivot tables, as well as its flexibility in shaping and organizing data for reports.

For this project, I focused on the following key points, which I'll walk you through:

1. Understanding business context and stakeholders

2. Defining business questions

3. Identifying potential insights for the report

4. Performing data transformations

5. Highlighting specific insights

6. Recommendations

7. Useful resources
